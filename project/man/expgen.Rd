\title{expgen
Exponential distribution is a popular distribution which is used to model waiting times and memoryless processes. This function gives you a number which follows exponential distribution. It uses uniform distribution function (cugen ()) to make exponential distributed numbers. It is calculated by 1/lambda*log(x).}
